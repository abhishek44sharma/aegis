(C) Finalize `README.md`.
(D) Process `TODO:` items in the projects. +aegis 
(B) Finalize diagrams. +aegis 
(C) create a broad-brushstrokes roadmap.
(D) the website needs some content +aegis 
(E) what about mTLS? Maybe offload it to a mesh and keep it out of scope and/or conditionally enable with a configuration flag. +aegis 
(E) there is almost no logging in fail cases, incrase logging +aegis 
(E) right now everything is in memory; maybe provide other backing stores +aegis
(B) note that the initial prototype stores things “in memory” without encryption; it might be nice to introduce `sops` next when things stabilize +aegis 
(C) Add documentation to all publicly exported functions everywhere +aegis 
(C) Code cleanup everywhere +aegis
(A) use `sops` and `age` in some way, shape or form +aegis +safe @mvp 
(E) ability to rotate notaryId and safeId. +aegis 
(D) idea: integration with `SPIRE`. If there is a SPIRE server that `aegis` can piggyback on, then let it manage the registration instead of all these token and secret exchange.
(C) main goal is to keep things simple, usable, and cloud-native. I will most certainly assume some form of Kubernetes exists. +aegis 
(C) main goal: be pragrmatic +aegis — find the right balance between convenience and security by default, and let people to opt in for more secure updates if they want/need to. — the in memory store is a very good example: if people want, they can opt in for sops, but keeping thing in memory is secure enough in itself, the inconvenience here will be losing secrets when safe goes down; some can tolerate it, and some might need to persist the secrets in an encrypted way.
(D) exchange workload secrets and notary token regularly. +aegis
