## Status of This Software

**Work In Progress**.

This project is a work in progress.

Stay tuned. More to come.

## About Aegis

**Aegis** is a comprehensive secrets management solution that helps you keep 
your secrets secret. With **Aegis**, you can rest assured that your sensitive 
data is **secure** and **protected** at all times. 

With its industry-standard encryption capabilities, **Aegis** ensures that your 
secrets are only accessible to authorized users, helping you safeguard your 
business and protect against data breaches.

## Project Folder Structure

// note: `k create ns aegis-system` first.

// TODO: this is a monorepo; explain how it works.

// TODO: explain the project’s folder structure.


// k exec -it aegis-sentinel-6558cbd5f9-7ddw9 -n aegis-system -- /bin/zsh

// TODO: comparison with vault.
// much less moving parts
// much simpler 
// very little footprint
// perfect for storing arbitrary configuration info
// future plans include cloud KMS integration thanks to Mozilla sops.
// simple api
// extremely small attack surface.

// TODO: talk about constraints as in:
// * This is a Kubernetes-first Cloud Native project
// * will start with a minimal API set.
// * Initially, the configuration and integration options will be limited.
// * There will be a timeline and a list of features that will be added.
// * There will be a place to provide feedback and request more features.

// TODO: talk about system requirements; where Aegis is tested and how.

// TODO: Right now, there is only a single person behind this thing (yours truly)
// that has its advantages (as me being the benevolent dictator) but also 
// limitations (I work on Aegis on my **persona** time).

// TODO: to docs: using a `todo.txt` format to track issues, as this is 
// the fastest way to bootsrap a project. Will continue to do text-base
// issue management until the project is either mature enough, or I start feeling
// some pain. — maybe I won’t need to use GitHub issues “ever”, not sure.

// TODO: NotaryId and SafeID will typically be generated by CI.
// TOOD: maybe write a generator script to generate all needed yamls.

// Bootstrap process: exchange safe (but known) token with a more secure unknown
// and randomly-generated token.
// after bootstrapping, workloads use workload id and workload secret
// after bootstrapping, notary uses (again a randomly-generated) notary token 
// for interaction with safe. 

pasting more random stuff to be organized.

```text
# `notary` -> `safe`

# “Hey `safe`, I am `notary`, here is my id (that you already know)
# and here is the workload token that we will share from this point on when
# communicating with workloads. I will also deliver you workload ids and
# workload secrets. The workloads will identify themselves with those ids
# and secrets.”
# “Ah, by the way, this is the admin token, figure out a way to securely
# dispatch it to the admins. You can store it at say /opt/aegis/admin.token
# for now; and later down the line create mini cli app that will display the
# token only once for the admin to store safely.”


# TODO: probably we need an “unregister” API too.

# `notary` -> `safe`

# The workload API is used by `notary` to register a workload to `safe`.
# `safe` will not dispatch secrets to a workload if it is not registered.
#  `workloadId` and `workloadToken` are generated by `notary`.

# `admin` -> `safe`

# Keep the admin token safe; do not store it in source control.
# An ideal place to store it is a password manager or an encrypted file.
# Admin retrieves secure admin token via a secure means after `notary`
# bootstraps `safe`.


# `workload` -> `safe`

# `SecureWorkloadToken` has been shared with the workload by `notary`.
# This shall deliver the token that admin has created for this workload.

```

Securing the admin key

you will need a private key and a public key;
you will have to keep your private key “private”

safe:
PUT /v1/crypto/key { publicKey: key } will register your public key.

GET /v1/admin/key => will return the admin key encrypted with your public key.

you can use aegis-keygen command line utility to generate a key pair.
you can again use aegis-keygen command line utility to decrypt your admin token

if either safe or notary crashes and restarts (after a successful bootstrap),
you'll have to provide your private key to safe to recover from last known
state. your private key is never logged or stored on disk, and it will be
wiped out from memory as soon as there is no more need for it.

Key Rotation: to be done in the future; right now admin token, notary token, 
and workload tokens are everlasting once they are dispatched.

====

Aegis is a word of Greek origin and is pronounced "EE-jiss." Not "AY-juss," and 
**not "AY-giss"**. It was adopted into Latin eventually, and may have been 
pronounced differently there, but "EE-jiss" is the only recognized English 
pronunciation of the word.

It has two definitions (from dictionary.com):
1.) Classical Mythology. The shield or breastplate of Zeus or Athena, bearing at its center the head of the Gorgon.
2.) Protection; support.

Image of an aegis as depicted in Greek mythology: http://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/aegis_228.jpg

update:
apparently Merriam-Webster lists "AY-jiss" as a secondary pronunciation

Note that this part is highly work-in-progress. Everything is under **a lot** of
